          JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) has become the de facto standard for data interchange on the web and beyond. Its simplicity and human-readable format make it easy to work with, but as JSON data grows in complexity and size, tools are indispensable for tasks like formatting, validation, and manipulation. Over time, these tools have evolved significantly, shifting from simple, offline utilities to powerful, cloud-connected platforms. This evolution reflects changing developer workflows, increasing data complexity, and the growing need for collaboration and advanced features.

          Hybrid Approaches and IDE Integration
        </h2>
        <p>
          The distinction isn't always black and white. Many modern tools offer hybrid capabilities or exist within environments that blend standalone and connected features:
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 mt-4">
          <li>
            **Browser Extensions:** These often combine client-side formatting/validation with optional connections for schema fetching or sharing.
          </li>
          <li>
            **IDE Plugins:** Popular Integrated Development Environments <LayoutPanelLeft className="inline h-5 w-5 text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-400" /> have built-in or plugin-based JSON support, offering formatting, validation (sometimes schema-aware), and syntax highlighting directly within the coding workflow. These function mostly standalone but benefit from the IDE's broader connectivity for things like package management (which might include JSON schema libraries).
          </li>
          <li>
            **Tools with Tiered Features:** Some online tools offer basic formatting/validation client-side while requiring login/connection for advanced features like history, sharing <Share2 className="inline h-5 w-5 text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-400" />, or schema validation.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          This hybrid model allows developers to choose the level of connectivity and feature complexity based on their needs and data sensitivity.
