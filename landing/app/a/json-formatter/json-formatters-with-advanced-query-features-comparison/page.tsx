      <h1 className="text-3xl font-bold mb-6">JSON Formatters with Advanced Query Features: A Comparison</h1>

      <div className="space-y-8">
        <p>
          JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) has become the de facto standard for data interchange across the web and
          countless applications. While basic JSON formatting (pretty-printing, minifying) is a common task, developers
          often need to do more than just read the data. Debugging APIs, analyzing large configuration files, or
          inspecting complex data structures frequently requires the ability to efficiently search and extract specific
          pieces of information. This is where JSON formatters with <strong>advanced query features</strong> come into
          play.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 flex items-center">
          <Search className="w-6 h-6 mr-2 text-blue-500" /> Why Advanced Querying Matters
        </h2>
        <p>Consider these common scenarios where simple copy-pasting into a basic formatter falls short:</p>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 my-4">
          <li>
            <strong>Debugging Large API Responses:</strong> An API returns megabytes of nested JSON. You need to find
            the value of a specific field, say <code>&quot;orderId&quot;</code>, deeply nested within one of potentially
            hundreds of items in an array.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Configuration Management:</strong> You have a complex JSON configuration file and need to verify
            that a specific feature flag is enabled under a certain condition structure.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Log Analysis:</strong> Logs are output as JSON objects per line. You need to filter for errors from
            a specific module and extract the error message and timestamp.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Data Exploration:</strong> Working with a new dataset in JSON format, you want to quickly see all
            the unique values for a particular attribute or find objects matching certain criteria.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          In these cases, manual inspection is time-consuming and error-prone. Advanced querying provides programmatic
          access to navigate and filter the JSON structure.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 flex items-center">
          <Code className="w-6 h-6 mr-2 text-green-500" /> Common Query Languages
        </h2>
        <p>
          Several query languages have emerged specifically for navigating and extracting data from JSON. The most
          prominent ones you&apos;ll encounter in formatters and tools are:
        </p>

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6">JSONPath</h3>
        <p>
          Inspired by XPath for XML, JSONPath provides a path expression syntax to select elements from a JSON
          structure.
        </p>
        <div className="bg-gray-100 p-4 rounded-lg dark:bg-gray-800 my-4">
          <h4 className="text-lg font-medium mb-2">JSONPath Examples:</h4>
          <div className="bg-white p-3 rounded dark:bg-gray-900 overflow-x-auto text-sm">
            <pre>
              {`$.store.book[0].title         // The title of the first book
$..author                   // All authors in the document
$.store.*                   // All elements in the store object
$.store..price              // All prices in the store
$..book[?(@.isbn)]         // All books with an ISBN number
$..book[?(@.price < 10)]  // All books cheaper than 10
$..book[0,1]               // The first two books
$..book[:2]                // The first two books (slice)
$..book[-1:]               // The last book (slice)`}
            </pre>
          </div>
        </div>
        <p>
          JSONPath is widely supported and relatively easy to learn for basic paths. Filter expressions (using{" "}
          <code>?()</code>) add powerful conditional selection.
        </p>

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6">JMESPath</h3>
        <p>
          JMESPath (pronounced &quot;James path&quot;) is another query language, often found in command-line tools like
          AWS CLI and certain libraries. It has a distinct syntax and includes functions for manipulating data (e.g.,
          sorting, aggregating).
        </p>
        <div className="bg-gray-100 p-4 rounded-lg dark:bg-gray-800 my-4">
          <h4 className="text-lg font-medium mb-2">JMESPath Examples:</h4>
          <div className="bg-white p-3 rounded dark:bg-gray-900 overflow-x-auto text-sm">
            <pre>
              {`store.book[0].title        // The title of the first book
store.book[*].author       // All authors in the store
store.book[?isbn].title    // Titles of books with an ISBN
store.book[?price < \`10\`].title // Titles of books cheaper than 10 (numbers need backticks sometimes depending on implementation)
people[?age > \`30\`].name  // Names of people older than 30
reservations[*].instances[*].{id: InstanceId, type: InstanceType} // Project and flatten data`}
            </pre>
          </div>
        </div>
        <p>
          JMESPath is powerful for transformation and projection of results, not just selection. Its syntax can feel
          slightly different from JSONPath but is very capable.

          Basic JSON formatting is a solved problem, but interacting with complex or large JSON data effectively
          requires more sophisticated tools. Formatters equipped with advanced query features, whether through JSONPath,
          JMESPath, or custom syntaxes, significantly enhance a developer&apos;s ability to understand, debug, and
          extract value from JSON. By considering factors like query language support, UI usability, performance on
          large files, and integrated features, you can select the right tool to streamline your JSON-related tasks.
          Embrace the power of querying to move beyond just pretty-printing and truly master your JSON data.
