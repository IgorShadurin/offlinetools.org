            <strong>T-shirts:</strong> A classic item for increasing brand visibility at events or in everyday wear.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Pins or Badges:</strong> Smaller items, good for backpacks or jackets. Sticker badges are a digital

          puns.

          </li>
          <li>

            <strong>Event Handouts:</strong> Simple distribution at physical gatherings.

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 flex items-center gap-2">Designing the Swag: Tips for Appeal</h2>
        <p>The effectiveness of swag heavily depends on its design. For developers, cool designs matter!</p>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 my-4">
          <li>
            <strong>High Quality:</strong> Use durable materials, especially for stickers that go on laptops or bottles.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Relevant & Clever:</strong> Incorporate themes related to JSON, formatting, code, or the specific
            tool's features. Puns or inside jokes resonate well with developer audiences.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Visually Appealing:</strong> Good graphics, clear logos, and appealing color schemes are essential.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Variety:</strong> Offer a few different sticker designs or swag items to cater to different tastes.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Subtle Branding:</strong> Sometimes, a smaller logo or a design that integrates the brand cleverly
            is more appealing than a giant logo.
          </li>
        </ul>

          <h3 className="text-lg font-medium">Example Sticker Design Ideas for a JSON Formatter:</h3>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 mt-2">
            <li>A sticker with a perfectly formatted JSON snippet.</li>
            <li>An icon representing "clean" or "organized" data.</li>
            <li>
              The tool's logo integrated with a JSON syntax element (e.g., a brace `{/* &#x7b; */}` or bracket `
              {/* [ */}`).
            </li>
            <li>A minimalist design with just the tool's name or logo.</li>
            <li>A humorous take on dealing with unformatted or invalid JSON.</li>
          </ul>
          <p className="mt-4 text-sm italic">
            Note: For code snippets or syntax examples on swag/stickers, ensure readability and visual appeal. Simple `
            {/* &#x7b; "key": "value" &#x7d; */}` structures work well.
