      <div className="space-y-6 text-base leading-relaxed">
        <p>
          Building intuitive and accessible interfaces for editing complex data structures, like deep and wide JSON
          objects, presents unique challenges. One of the most critical, yet often overlooked, aspects is{" "}
          <strong className="font-semibold">Focus Management</strong>. Proper focus handling ensures users can
          efficiently navigate, edit, and interact with the interface, especially when dealing with dynamic content,
          validation errors, or nested elements.
        </p>

          <Accessibility className="w-6 h-6" />
          <h2>Why Focus Management Matters</h2>
        </div>
        <p>Effective focus management isn&apos;t just about where the blinking cursor is. It significantly impacts:</p>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
          <li>
            <strong>Accessibility:</strong> Users relying on keyboards, screen readers, or other assistive technologies
            depend entirely on a logical and predictable focus order to understand and interact with the page content.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>User Experience:</strong> A poor focus experience leads to frustration. Users get lost, clicks or
            key presses don&apos;t go where expected, and the interface feels broken or sluggish. Smooth navigation is
            key to productivity.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Keyboard Navigation:</strong> Developers and power users often prefer keyboard shortcuts for speed.
            Proper focus ensures standard navigation keys (like Tab, Shift+Tab, Arrow keys) work as expected.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Context Awareness:</strong> When actions like saving or validating occur, bringing the user&apos;s
            focus to relevant information (like error messages or a success indicator) improves usability.
          </li>
        </ul>

          <h2>Challenges in JSON Editing Interfaces</h2>
        </div>
        <p>JSON editors, particularly tree or form-based ones, add complexity due to:</p>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
          <li>
            <strong>Nested Structures:</strong> Navigating between parent objects/arrays and their children means focus
            needs to descend and ascend through nested components.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Dynamic Content:</strong> Adding or removing fields, array items, or entire objects changes the DOM
            structure, requiring careful handling of where focus should go next. Losing focus entirely or sending it
            unexpectedly to the top of the page is common. <Plus className="inline w-4 h-4" />
            <Minus className="inline w-4 h-4" />
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Validation Errors:</strong> When validation fails, focus should often be directed to the first field
            with an error, or to a summary of errors.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Heterogeneous Field Types:</strong> A JSON object can contain strings, numbers, booleans, null,
            nested objects, and arrays, each potentially rendered with a different input type (text input, number input,
            checkbox, dropdown, etc.), each with its own focus behavior. <Square className="inline w-4 h-4" />
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Complex Interactions:</strong> Features like drag-and-drop reordering, inline editing of keys and
            values, or context menus add layers of interaction that can interfere with standard focus flow.
          </li>
        </ul>

          <h2>Core Principles for JSON Editor Focus</h2>
        </div>
        <p>To address these challenges, consider these principles:</p>
        <ol className="list-decimal pl-6 space-y-2">
          <li>
            <strong>Establish a Logical Tab Order:</strong> Ensure users can tab through the editable fields and
            interactive elements in a sequence that makes sense. For nested structures, this typically means traversing
            child fields before moving to the next sibling field at the parent level.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Handle Dynamic Changes Gracefully:</strong>
            <ul className="list-[lower-alpha] pl-6 space-y-1 mt-1">
              <li>When adding a new field, place focus into the key or value input of the newly added field.</li>
              <li>
                When removing a field, attempt to move focus to a logically adjacent element, such as the previous or
                next field in the same list or object, or the parent object/array if no siblings exist. Avoid losing
                focus entirely.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Manage Focus on Validation:</strong>
            <ul className="list-[lower-alpha] pl-6 space-y-1 mt-1">
              <li>After a validation attempt (e.g., on save), identify the first invalid field and set focus there.</li>
              <li>
                If showing a summary of errors, ensure the error summary itself is focusable, or that navigating from
                the summary links/buttons focuses the corresponding field.{" "}
                <CircleAlert className="inline w-4 h-4 text-red-500" />
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Enhance Keyboard Navigation:</strong> Beyond just Tab, consider supporting:
            <ul className="list-[lower-alpha] pl-6 space-y-1 mt-1">
              <li>Arrow keys for navigating between fields within an object or array.</li>
              <li>Enter key to initiate editing or confirm changes.</li>
              <li>
                Escape key to cancel editing or close modals. <Keyboard className="inline w-4 h-4" />
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Utilize ARIA Attributes:</strong> Use ARIA attributes like <code>aria-label</code>,{" "}
            <code>aria-describedby</code>, <code>aria-invalid=&quot;true&quot;</code>, and <code>aria-expanded</code>{" "}
            (for collapsible sections) to provide context to screen readers about the state and purpose of elements.
          </li>
        </ol>

          <h2>Implementation Approaches (Conceptual)</h2>
        </div>
        <p>
          While actual implementation details require client-side JavaScript (not allowed here), understanding the
          conceptual approaches is vital:
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
          <li>
            <strong>Browser Defaults:</strong> Standard interactive elements like <code>&lt;input&gt;</code>,{" "}
            <code>&lt;button&gt;</code>, and <code>&lt;select&gt;</code> are naturally focusable and participate in the
            default tab order. Leveraging this is the first step.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>
              <code>tabIndex</code> Attribute:
            </strong>
            <ul className="list-[lower-alpha] pl-6 space-y-1 mt-1">
              <li>
                <code>tabIndex=&quot;0&quot;</code>: Includes an element in the natural tab order. Useful for elements
                that aren&apos;t natively focusable but should be (e.g., a custom div acting as a button).
              </li>
              <li>
                <code>tabIndex=&quot;-1&quot;</code>: Makes an element programmatically focusable (via JavaScript&apos;s{" "}
                <code>.focus()</code> method) but removes it from the natural tab order. Useful for focusing specific
                elements like error summaries or newly added fields without disrupting the user&apos;s tab flow
                elsewhere.
              </li>
              <li>
                <code>tabIndex &gt; 0</code>: Defines an explicit tab order. Generally{" "}
                <strong className="font-semibold text-red-600 dark:text-red-400">avoided</strong> as it creates brittle
                interfaces that are hard to maintain and break standard browser behavior.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Programmatic Focus:</strong> Using JavaScript&apos;s <code>element.focus()</code> method is
            necessary for dynamically setting focus, such as focusing the first error field after validation, or the new
            input after adding an item.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Focus Trapping:</strong> For modals or dialogs within the editor (e.g., a complex value picker),
            ensure focus is &quot;trapped&quot; within the modal while it&apos;s open, preventing users from tabbing to
            elements behind the modal.
          </li>
        </ul>

          <h2>Example Scenarios &amp; Considerations</h2>
        </div>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
          <li>
            <strong>Adding an Array Item:</strong> After clicking &quot;Add Item&quot; button on an array, the new item
            appears. Focus should automatically move to the input field of this new item.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Deleting an Object Property:</strong> When deleting a key-value pair, focus should ideally move to
            the input of the previous key-value pair, or the next one if deleting the first. If it was the only
            property, focus might move to the object container itself or its label.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Expanding a Nested Object:</strong> Clicking an expand/collapse toggle for a nested object should
            not necessarily move focus, but the newly revealed child elements must be included in the tab order.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Validation Errors:</strong> After submitting or validating, if errors exist, a summary might appear.
            Clicking an error link in the summary should use programmatic focus to jump to the specific field with the
            error.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p className="mt-6">
          Implementing robust focus management requires careful planning and testing, especially with keyboard and
          screen reader users. It&apos;s an ongoing process during development to ensure all interaction paths maintain
          a logical and accessible focus flow. By prioritizing focus, developers create JSON editing interfaces that are
          not only powerful but also inclusive and easy to use for everyone.
