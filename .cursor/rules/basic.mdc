# Rules for project development

- We use pnpm to manage dependencies. Don't use npm at all
- Run `pnpm run lint && pnpm run types:check` after completing a task
- The project is a monorepo where the `@landing` directory is the landing page, and the `@shared` directory contains shared components and utilities used across the project

# Rules for developing the landing page

- The landing page is developed using TypeScript, Next.js, and Shadcn UI with Tailwind v4
- For any new component, first try to find and use an existing component from Shadcn UI (Tailwind v4)
- Keep in mind to develop all components mobile + pc friendly
