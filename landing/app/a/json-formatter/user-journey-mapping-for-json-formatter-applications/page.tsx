          </h2>
          <p>
            User Journey Mapping (UJM) is a powerful visualization tool that illustrates the steps a user takes to
            achieve a goal with your product or service. It helps you understand the user&apos;s experience from their
            perspective, highlighting touchpoints, emotions, pain points, and opportunities for improvement.
          </p>
          <p>
            Essentially, a user journey map tells a story about the user&apos;s interaction, often depicted as a
            timeline of actions, thoughts, and feelings.

          </h2>
          <p>
            A JSON formatter, validator, or transformer application might seem straightforward. A user pastes JSON,
            clicks a button, and gets the result. However, the context surrounding these simple actions is crucial. Why
            is the user here? What problem are they trying to solve? What are they doing before and after using your
            tool?
          </p>
          <p>
            Understanding these questions through UJM can reveal hidden frustrations and unmet needs, leading to a more
            intuitive and helpful tool. It moves beyond just functionality to focus on the overall user experience.

            While a deep dive into personas is a separate exercise, for a formatter, common user types might include:

          <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 my-4">

            For instance, addressing privacy concerns by emphasizing client-side processing can be a significant
            advantage.
