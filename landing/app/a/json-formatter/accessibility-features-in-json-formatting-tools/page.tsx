      <div className="space-y-6">
        <p>
          As developers, we often spend hours working with text-based tools, including JSON formatters. Ensuring these
          tools are accessible is crucial for providing an inclusive environment for all users, regardless of their
          abilities. Accessible JSON formatters not only comply with standards but also improve usability for everyone.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8">Why Accessibility Matters</h2>
        <p>
          Accessibility in software development tools ensures that individuals with disabilities can effectively use
          them. For JSON formatters, this means addressing needs related to vision, motor skills, and cognitive
          abilities. Features like keyboard navigation, screen reader compatibility, and adjustable visuals are
          paramount.
        </p>

          <h3 className="text-lg font-medium">Key areas of accessibility:</h3>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 mt-2">
            <li>Perceivable: Information and UI components must be presentable to users in ways they can perceive.</li>
            <li>Operable: UI components and navigation must be operable.</li>
            <li>Understandable: Information and the operation of UI must be understandable.</li>
            <li>
              Robust: Content must be robust enough that it can be interpreted reliably by a wide variety of user
              agents, including assistive technologies.
            </li>
          </ul>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8">Essential Accessibility Features</h2>

        <div className="bg-gray-100 p-4 rounded-lg dark:bg-gray-800 my-4">
          <h3 className="text-lg font-medium">1. Color Contrast and Themes</h3>
          <p className="text-sm mt-2">
            Sufficient color contrast between text and background is vital for users with visual impairments or color
            blindness. Accessible formatters offer themes (like high-contrast or dark mode) that meet
            <a
              href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/"
              target="_blank"

            contrast requirements. Syntax highlighting colors should also be distinguishable.
          </p>
          <div className="bg-white p-3 rounded dark:bg-gray-900 overflow-x-auto mt-3 text-xs">
            <pre>
              {`// Example of high-contrast friendly syntax highlighting
{
  "key": "value", // Key: #FFFF00 (Yellow), Value: #00FF00 (Green)
  "number": 123,  // Number: #FF00FF (Magenta)
  "boolean": true // Boolean: #00FFFF (Cyan)
}`}
            </pre>
          </div>
          <p className="text-sm mt-2">Look for tools that allow customization of syntax highlighting colors.</p>
        </div>

        <div className="bg-gray-100 p-4 rounded-lg dark:bg-gray-800 my-4">
          <h3 className="text-lg font-medium">2. Keyboard Navigation</h3>
          <p className="text-sm mt-2">
            Users who cannot use a mouse must be able to access all features using only a keyboard. This includes:
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-1 mt-2 text-sm">
            <li>Tabbing through controls (text areas, buttons, options).</li>
            <li>Using arrow keys to navigate within the JSON text area.</li>
            <li>Activating buttons and links with the Enter/Space key.</li>
            <li>Accessing context menus or additional options via keyboard shortcuts.</li>
          </ul>
          <p className="text-sm mt-2">
            Test a tool's keyboard navigation by trying to perform all actions (pasting, formatting, copying,
            validating) without touching your mouse.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div className="bg-gray-100 p-4 rounded-lg dark:bg-gray-800 my-4">
          <h3 className="text-lg font-medium">3. Screen Reader Support</h3>
          <p className="text-sm mt-2">
            Screen readers (software used by visually impaired users to read digital text aloud) need well-structured
            and properly labeled web elements. Accessible JSON formatters should:
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-1 mt-2 text-sm">
            <li>Use semantic HTML or ARIA attributes to clearly label interactive elements (buttons, input fields).</li>
            <li>Announce significant updates, like validation errors or formatting success.</li>
            <li>Allow screen readers to navigate and read the content of the JSON text area effectively.</li>
          </ul>
          <p className="text-sm mt-2">
            Ensure the input/output areas and action buttons are clearly identified by screen reader software.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div className="bg-gray-100 p-4 rounded-lg dark:bg-gray-800 my-4">
          <h3 className="text-lg font-medium">4. Font Size and Readability</h3>
          <p className="text-sm mt-2">
            Users should be able to adjust the font size of the JSON text area without breaking the layout. Clear,
            readable fonts are also preferred. Features like line wrapping are helpful for preventing horizontal
            scrolling, which can be difficult for some users.
          </p>
          <div className="bg-white p-3 rounded dark:bg-gray-900 overflow-x-auto mt-3 text-xs">
            <pre>
              {`// Ensure long lines wrap correctly if feature is enabled
{
  "veryLongKeyNameThatCouldCauseHorizontalScrollingIfWrappingIsNotEnabled": "this is a long value that demonstrates the importance of line wrapping for readability",
  "anotherKey": "anotherValue"
}`}
            </pre>
          </div>
          <p className="text-sm mt-2">
            Look for zoom functionality and settings to control text size and line wrapping.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div className="bg-gray-100 p-4 rounded-lg dark:bg-gray-800 my-4">
          <h3 className="text-lg font-medium">5. Error Reporting and Feedback</h3>
          <p className="text-sm mt-2">
            Error messages should be clear, concise, and easily perceivable. Beyond just red highlighting, accessible
            formatters should:
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-1 mt-2 text-sm">
            <li>Provide specific error descriptions (e.g., "Missing comma at line 5, character 10").</li>
            <li>Indicate the error location clearly (line number, visual marker).</li>
            <li>Offer accessible notifications for success messages (e.g., "JSON formatted successfully").</li>
          </ul>
          <p className="text-sm mt-2">
            Ensure error messages are not solely reliant on color and are announced by screen readers if needed.
          </p>
        </div>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8">Choosing an Accessible Tool</h2>
        <p>When selecting or developing a JSON formatting tool, consider the following:</p>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 my-4">
          <li>Check for compliance statements (e.g., WCAG 2.1 AA).</li>
          <li>Test with assistive technologies (screen readers, keyboard-only navigation).</li>
          <li>Look for configurable settings (themes, font sizes).</li>
          <li>Prioritize tools with clear error reporting.</li>
          <li>Read user reviews regarding accessibility experiences.</li>
        </ul>

        <div className="bg-gray-100 p-4 rounded-lg dark:bg-gray-800 my-6">
          <h3 className="text-lg font-medium">Pro Tip:</h3>
          <p className="mt-2">
            Even if you don&apos;t currently use assistive technologies, testing tools with them can reveal usability
            issues that affect all users. Features designed for accessibility often improve the user experience for
            everyone.
          </p>
        </div>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8">Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
          Accessibility in JSON formatting tools is not just about compliance; it&apos;s about creating development
          environments that are usable and effective for the widest possible range of users. By prioritizing features
          like high-contrast themes, keyboard navigation, screen reader support, adjustable fonts, and clear error
          messaging, we can ensure that everyone can format and validate JSON efficiently and comfortably.
        </p>
        <p>
          Advocate for and choose tools that demonstrate a commitment to accessibility, making the digital workspace
          more inclusive for the entire developer community.
