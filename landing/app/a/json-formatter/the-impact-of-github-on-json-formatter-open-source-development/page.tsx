      <h1 className="text-3xl font-bold mb-6">The Impact of GitHub on JSON Formatter Open Source Development</h1>

      <div className="space-y-6">
        <p>
          JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is the de facto standard for data interchange on the web. JSON formatters
          are essential tools that help developers read, write, and validate JSON data by adding indentation, line
          breaks, and syntax highlighting. The development of these formatters has been significantly accelerated and
          shaped by the open-source ecosystem, with GitHub playing a pivotal role.
        </p>

        <p>
          GitHub, as the leading platform for Git repository hosting and collaboration, has provided the infrastructure
          and community features that have allowed open-source JSON formatters to thrive. Let&apos;s delve into the
          specific ways GitHub has impacted this space.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8">1. Revolutionizing Version Control and Collaboration</h2>
        <p>
          Before platforms like GitHub, coordinating contributions to open-source projects was often cumbersome. GitHub,
          built on Git, simplifies distributed version control, making it easy for multiple developers to work on the
          same project simultaneously without stepping on each other&apos;s toes.
