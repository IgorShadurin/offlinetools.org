              <p>
                At Offline Tools, privacy isn&apos;t just a policyâ€”it&apos;s our core mission. We believe your data belongs to you, 
                which is why our tools are designed to work entirely offline, ensuring your information never leaves your device 
                without your knowledge or consent.

              <p>
                This Privacy Policy explains our approach to data collection, processing, and your rights regarding any information 
                that might be collected when you visit our website.
