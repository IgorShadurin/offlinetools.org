        <p>
          JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data-interchange format widely used across the web.
          However, one common complaint about standard JSON is its lack of support for comments. This limitation
          can make configuration files or complex data structures harder to understand without external
          documentation.
        </p>

        <p>
          JSON5 is an extension of JSON that aims to make it easier for humans to write and maintain, while still
          being a subset of ECMAScript 5 (like JSON). One of its most popular features is the ability to include
          comments. This guide explores how to work with comments in JSON5 and why it&apos;s a valuable feature.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8">Why Standard JSON Doesn&apos;t Allow Comments</h2>
        <p>
          The original JSON specification deliberately omitted comments. Douglas Crockford, the creator of JSON,
          stated that he removed comments because he saw people using them to include parsing directives. His goal
          was to keep JSON purely a data format, free from implementation details or instructions within the data
          itself. While this decision keeps JSON simple and focused, it removes a useful feature for human readability
          and maintainability, especially for configuration files.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8">JSON5: JSON for Humans</h2>
        <p>
          JSON5 extends JSON with several features aimed at improving human readability. These include:
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 mt-2">
          <li>Comments (single-line and multi-line)</li>
          <li>Trailing commas in objects and arrays</li>
          <li>Unquoted object keys (if they are valid identifiers)</li>
          <li>Single-quoted strings</li>
          <li>Multiline strings</li>
          <li>Reserved words as keys</li>
          <li>Other number formats (hexadecimal, positive/negative infinity, NaN)</li>
        </ul>
        <p className="mt-4">
          Among these, the ability to add comments is arguably the most significant for documentation and clarity.
        </p>


        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8">Adding Comments in JSON5</h2>
        <p>
          JSON5 supports two types of comments familiar from JavaScript and many other programming languages:
        </p>

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6">1. Single-Line Comments (`//`)</h3>
        <p>
          These comments start with two forward slashes (`//`) and continue to the end of the line. They are
          useful for adding brief explanations or notes next to specific properties or values.
        </p>
        <div className="bg-gray-100 p-4 rounded-lg dark:bg-gray-800 my-4">
          <div className="bg-white p-3 rounded dark:bg-gray-900 overflow-x-auto">
            <pre>
              {`{
  "database": {
    "host": "localhost", // Database server address
    "port": 5432,        // Port number for connection
    "username": "admin"
    // Note: Password should be stored securely, not here!
  },
  "api": {
    "timeout": 5000      // API request timeout in ms
  }
}`}
            </pre>
          </div>
          <p className="mt-2 text-sm">
            Single-line comments provide inline context for individual lines or properties.
          </p>
        </div>

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6">2. Multi-Line Comments (`/* */`)</h3>
        <p>
          These comments start with `/*` and end with `*/`. They can span multiple lines and are ideal for
          more detailed explanations, descriptions of sections, or temporarily commenting out blocks of code.
        </p>
        <div className="bg-gray-100 p-4 rounded-lg dark:bg-gray-800 my-4">
          <div className="bg-white p-3 rounded dark:bg-gray-900 overflow-x-auto">
            <pre>
              {`{
  /*
    Application Configuration File

    This file contains settings for database connections,
    API endpoints, feature flags, etc.
    Please be careful when modifying this file.
  */
  "appSettings": {
    "appName": "My Awesome App",
    "version": "1.0.0"
  },
  /*
  "featureFlags": {
    "beta": true, // Temporarily disabled for production testing
    "new_dashboard": false
  },
  */
  "logging": {
    "level": "info" // Set logging level (debug, info, warn, error)
  }
}`}
            </pre>
          </div>
          <p className="mt-2 text-sm">
            Multi-line comments are useful for longer descriptions or commenting out sections.
          </p>
        </div>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8">Benefits of Using Comments in JSON5</h2>
        <p>
          Adding comments to your JSON5 files offers several advantages:
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 mt-2">
          <li>
            <span className="font-medium">Improved Readability:</span> Explain complex settings or data structures directly within the file.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span className="font-medium">Easier Maintenance:</span> Future users (including yourself) can quickly understand the purpose of different parts of the configuration or data.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span className="font-medium">Self-Documenting:</span> The file becomes its own documentation, reducing the need for separate documents (though complex systems may still require them).
          </li>
          <li>
            <span className="font-medium">Temporary Disabling:</span> Easily comment out configuration options or data entries without deleting them.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8">Using JSON5-Compatible Formatters and Parsers</h2>
        <p>
          To work with JSON5 files, you need tools that understand the JSON5 specification. Standard JSON parsers will throw errors when encountering comments or other JSON5 features.
        </p>
        <p>
          Look for text editors, IDEs, and online formatters/validators that explicitly state support for JSON5. These tools will correctly parse, format, and validate your JSON5 files, including preserving or handling comments as appropriate.
        </p>
        <div className="bg-gray-100 p-4 rounded-lg dark:bg-gray-800 my-4">
           <h3 className="text-lg font-medium">Software and Libraries Supporting JSON5:</h3>
           <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 mt-2">
             <li>Many modern code editors (VS Code, Sublime Text, Atom, etc.) with appropriate plugins/extensions.</li>
             <li>Online JSON5 validators and formatters.</li>
             <li>Libraries in various programming languages (e.g., `json5` for JavaScript/Node.js, `python-json5` for Python) that provide parsing and stringifying capabilities.</li>
           </ul>
         </div>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8">Tips for Effective Commenting in JSON5</h2>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 my-4">
          <li>
            <span className="font-medium">Be Concise:</span> Comments should clarify, not clutter. Keep them brief and to the point.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span className="font-medium">Explain the Why:</span> Instead of just restating what the code does, explain *why* it does it or the purpose of a specific setting.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span className="font-medium">Keep Them Updated:</span> Outdated comments are misleading. Ensure comments are updated whenever the corresponding data changes.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span className="font-medium">Use for Configuration:</span> JSON5 is particularly useful for configuration files where human readability and notes are highly beneficial.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span className="font-medium">Validate:</span> Even with comments, always validate your JSON5 to catch syntax errors before using it.
          </li>
        </ul>

         <div className="bg-gray-100 p-4 rounded-lg dark:bg-gray-800 my-6">
           <h3 className="text-lg font-medium">Important Note:</h3>
           <p className="mt-2">
             While JSON5 is great for files maintained by humans, remember that standard JSON parsers will fail on JSON5 files with comments. If your JSON is being machine-generated or strictly consumed by systems expecting pure JSON, stick to the standard format or ensure your pipeline includes a JSON5-to-JSON conversion step.
           </p>
         </div>


        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8">Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
          JSON5, with its support for comments, significantly enhances the human-friendliness of JSON data. By
          allowing you to add explanations and notes directly within your files using single-line (`//`) and
          multi-line (`/* */`) comments, JSON5 makes configurations and complex data structures more understandable
          and maintainable.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you frequently work with JSON files that are read or edited by humans, adopting JSON5 and a compatible
          formatter can streamline your workflow and reduce errors caused by misunderstandings. Just remember to use
          comments judiciously and ensure your tools support the JSON5 format.
