# Rules for project development

- We use pnpm to manage dependencies
- The project is a monorepo where the `@landing` directory is the landing page, and the `@shared` directory contains shared components and utilities used across the project

# Rules for developing the landing page

- The landing page is developed using TypeScript, Next.js, and Shadcn UI (v4)
- For any new component, first try to find and use an existing component from Shadcn UI (v4)
